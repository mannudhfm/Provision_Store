          <li>I have used Vite React App for this project, it is a build tool and development server for web applications. It is designed to be fast and efficient, and is used to build modern web applications.</li>
          <li>I have place all the components Product, NavBar, About etc., in a single Component Folder. It is best practice for proper folder structure.</li>
          <li>I am facing some difficulty to create a login feature as mentioned in the task. I have tried but unfortunately it is not properly working for me. I am not sure if the problem is with the given credentials or with my code.</li>
          <li>Since, I have used Vite to create react app, in this case we have to run <b>npm run dev</b> command to run the project.</li>
